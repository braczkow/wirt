Dude, will it rain today? (also: WIRT)

A simple App that answers *the* question in a configurable* manner.

WIRT serves a playground Application to practice and demonstrate some Android/Kotlin/architecture
concepts.

Notabene:
#1 It's a multi-module project. ATM, the split is "horizontal":
- lib is the "base" module, any other module is allowed to depend on it
- app module is allowed to depend on anything
- "feature" modules (like openweather, cities*) may not depend on the "app" (or "ui"*) module
- whether particular "feature" modules might depend on each other is not determined yet
(I assume that for such a small project it's possible)
- Note that the app/ui module is meant to be split "horizontally", so that no screen depends on each
other

#2 WIRT is targeted to be Kotlin/flow based, with the goal to replace Rx BehaviorSubject with
Kotlin StateFlow. It's experimental, but so is this App

#3 There is some nice base Navigation implemented (see app.ui.common); please note that I strongly
support the idea that view state(model) is something different than view-like actions. The former is
meant to be standardized with a StateFlow-based solution* For the latter,
following approach applies:
- Navigation interface which exposes _directions_ flow (to be consumed by a Fragment)
- Navigator interface which exposes _navigate_ fun (to be used internally by a ViewModel)
- NavigationHost, which is a generic class that implements the 2 former interfaces
- BaseViewModel, which internally uses NavigationHost, but only exposes
-- protected navigate() fun to be used by ViewModels
-- public _directions_ flow to be used by Fragments

The most important part is that NavigationHost implements the _directions_ flow as an
UNLIMITED fan-out channel. This way, ViewModel can post as many directions as it wants, while a
Fragment would consume them when it collects (typically between _onStart_ and _onStop_). Once
collected direction is never re-emitted, so the problem that both BehaviorSubject and LiveData have
(google for SingleLiveEvent) is never there! :)

#4 WIRT is designed to provide a simple UI for settings, and virtually no UI for everyday use.
Badge actions, Toasts and notifications: you are my only hope!*
